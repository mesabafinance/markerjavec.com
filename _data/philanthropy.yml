            I have supported a variety of civic and philanthropic causes throughout my career. 
            In 2004, I served as a founding benefactor for the Center for Community Stewardship, 
            an organization originally intended to support community conversations regarding 
            redevelopment. Embarking on a challenging international platform, I planned and 
            subsequently created the Kyiv Parks Foundation to support the redevelopment of public 
            parks and recreational venues within the city of Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2016, I began my 
            journey with Rotary International, becoming a member of the Kyiv Multinational Club. 
            Today I am a member of the Rotary Club 31 in Denver, Colorado.
