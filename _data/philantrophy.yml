      I have supported a variety of civic and philanthropic causes throughout my career. 
      In 2004 I served as a founding benefactor for the Center for Community Stewardship, 
      an organization originally intended to support community conversations regarding 
      redevelopment. Embarking on a challenging international platform, I planned and 
      subsequently created the Kyiv Parks Foundation to support the redevelopment of public 
      parks and recreational venues within the city of Kyiv Ukraine. In 2016 I began my 
      journey with Rotary International, becoming a member of the Kyiv Multinational Club. 
      Today I am a member of the Rotary Club 31 in Denver Colorado.
