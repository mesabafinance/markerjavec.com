      One of my principal philantrophic activities is supporting local Rotary Clubs. 
      I have closely accompanied the foundation of 
      <a href="https://my.rotary.org/en/club-profile/431D981E-4EC9-4800-955D-6D32DCB29B91" 
      target="_blank">Kyiv Multinational Rotary Club</a>, which 
      received its charter on June 12, 2006 from the President of Rotary International, 
      Carl Whilhem Stenhammer. Right from the start, we have executed important projects 
      such as putting incubators in regional hospitals, purchasing 
      an important ultrasound scanner for an all-Ukraine hospital for lesions to the central 
      nervous system, training doctors in cleft operations, establishing a patients organisation 
      for cerebral palsy and putting computers in 59 schools around the front-line in the east.
