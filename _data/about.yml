      As a young entrepreneur I honed my skills as a salesman and capital raiser working 
      with a variety of individual entrepreneurs at a time when utilizing leverage in 
      real estate was a growing trend. In the late 1990s, I capitalized on my experience 
      and relationships that I had earned with successful entrepreneurs to operate 
      proprietary investment funds and a small investment banking practice.

      A staff hire I made in the early 2001 introduced me to my first international individual 
      investor, and since then I have developed relationships with approximately 50 high and 
      ultra-high net worth individual investors from around the world.

      Today, I specialize in funding and developing agribusinesses around the world. 
      The projects I invest in cover a wide range of technologies, including agricultural 
      drone technology, indoor farming, and financing of agricultural equipment for farmers 
      across the United States and Europe.
