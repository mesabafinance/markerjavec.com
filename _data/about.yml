            As a young entrepreneur I honed my skills as a salesman and capital raiser working 
            with a variety of individual entrepreneurs at a time when utilizing leverage in 
            real estate was a growing trend. In the late 1990s, I capitalized on my experience 
            and relationships that I had earned with successful entrepreneurs to operate 
            proprietary investment funds and a small investment banking practice.
        - >-
            A staff hire I made in the early 2001 introduced me to my first international individual 
            investor, and since then I have developed relationships with approximately 50 high and 
            ultra-high net worth individual investors from around the world.
        - >-
            These relationships allowed me to work on deals in varying industries and establish an 
            eastern European hub, that helped to deepen my investor base, expand my comprehension 
            of global businesses and pursue social and philanthropic causes for the greater good.
