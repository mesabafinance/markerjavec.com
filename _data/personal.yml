      In addition to my business pursuits, I have a strong interest in fine arts. I draw inspiration 
      for my personal life from poems and speeches by great writers and speakers. My 
      favorite texts include <em>Horatius at the Bridge, Indecision,</em> and <em>Man in the Arena</em>, which are listed below.
      Another area of particular interest is paintings, specifically oil paintings. Below you will find a 
      gallery of my favorite paintings, from both American and Russian painters, 
      which I have viewed in person frequently. The gallery contains 
      additional commentary for each painting.

        heading: Horatius at the Bridge
        author: Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay

          I appreciate how this poem longs for the eternal quest to develop people whom will 
          stand beside us and be loyal.

          Then stepped forward Horatius, the Captain of the gate. 
          He said, 'To every man of woman born death cometh soon or late.
          And how can man die better than facing fearful odds
          For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods? ...

          Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may.
          I would, with but two beside me, will hold the foe in play.
          On yon narrow span 1,000 might well be stopped by three.
          Now, who will stand on either hand and guard the bridge with me?

        heading: Indecision
        author: Ted Turner
        comment: >-
                This poem relates to harnessing opportunity when it arrives to you through 
                chance, through luck, or through having earned it.  The difference between 
                success and failure is how we handle that opportunity.

          While great Caesar lay yet dying
          Brutus has a chance for glory  
          Had the future lain before him
          His would be a different story

          At the feet of Hannibal
          Like a ripe plum Rome once Lay
          Off he put the time of Conquest
          To a later, better day

          Hamlets course was lain before him
          All he had to do was act
          But he lacked the inner courage
          To make his deep convictions fact

          Shortly after first Manassas
          Fate knocked at the door of Lee
          But he failed to take advantage
          Or a different country this may be

          Many times throughout the ages
          Like as not the chance appears
          But because of indecision
          Manâ€™s fond hopes are drown in tears.

        author: Thedore Roosevelt

          It is not the critic who counts; 
          not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
          or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
          The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
          whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; 
          who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, 
          because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; 
          but who does actually strive to do the deeds; 
          who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; 
          who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
          who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
          and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, 
          so that his place shall never be with those cold and 
          timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

        As an avid entertainer I favor the representation of the friends enjoying a 
        lunch on a summer evening. I have lunches at the restaurant at the very patio 
        depicted in the painting in several occasions. My eye is drawn to the girl with 
        her small dog. I often imagine myself among the guests.

        The scene is especially attractive to me as it represents the defiance of a 
        suppressed people toward their arrogant overlord.

        The painting is personal to me in my frequent visits to it in that it represents 
        a dichotomy of loneliness and the yet a wanting to be together.
