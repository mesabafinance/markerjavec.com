As a young entrepreneur I honed my skills as a salesman and capital raiser working with a variety of individual entrepreneurs at a time when utilizing leverage in real estate was a growing trend. In the late 1990s, I capitalized on my experience and relationships that I had earned with successful entrepreneurs to operate proprietary investment funds and a small investment banking practice.

A staff hire I made in the early 2001 introduced me to my first international individual investor, and since then I have developed relationships with approximately 50 high and ultra-high net worth individual investors from around the world.

These relationships allowed me to work on deals in varying industries and establish an eastern European hub, that helped to deepen my investor base, expand my comprehension of global businesses and pursue social and philanthropic causes for the greater good.

Today, operating for the United States, I serve as the Chairperson and a key strategist of Mesaba Finance Company, Incorporated, the company that I first purchased in 1994, at age 18, three days after graduating from Eveleth/Gilbert High school in Minnesota.
