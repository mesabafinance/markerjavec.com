title: Maurice "Mosey" Banen

This short story is one in a series of 20 blog postings / short anecdotes related to a small finance company I acquired June 10, 1994 after having graduated from High School on June 7th of 1994 and the people and experiences I encountered along this journey.

Founded by Maurice “Mosey” Banen, of Hibbing Minnesota in 1938, Mesaba Finance played a small but significant role financing airplanes for the early days of the passenger aviation industry. By the time I acquired the company in 1994 it was a regional Regulated Lender in the State of Minnesota that specialized in automobile and to a lesser degree secured consumer financing. As I lead the company past its 80th year of business I am building a portfolio in a “new” version of aviation, the financing of large fleets of privately-owned heavy payload drones, utilized for industry.

Notably I purchased this company at age 18, as my second business after an early success developing a profitable advertising publication, and Mr. Banen was 89 years old upon selling the company to me having started and subsequently operated the business for decades after immigrating to the United States from Russia. After 24 years of challenges, luck in US real estate finance, and monetizing a decade of hard earned relationships in the eastern European capital markets, the principal administrative office of Mesaba Finance is now in the country of Ukraine.

The company traces its name to both the Mesaba Loan Company organized March 19, 1938 and the fact that it was organized on the Mesaba Iron Range. This range (a geographical formation that contains iron ore formations) is named Mesaba. Although there are a few translations of the word that can be found, the most consistent interpretation is from the Ojivwa (Chippewa) meaning of “Giant”. Therefore in my opinion, Mesaba = Giant.

## Who wants to be a Repo Man?

Throughout the 1980’s and early 1990’s the Mesaba Finance business plan was to lend money to consumers with shaky credit for automobile loans. This business model enables the lender to charge a higher rate of interested, while managing its risk because of its local presence and understanding of the communities that it is based in. The founder of the company, Maurice or “Mosey” as he was known about town having operated the business for decades was in his late 80’s and in declining health when we first met. I learned about him and his business reading a public interest article in the local newspaper.  Further, his family members had already retired and moved to warmer weather, therefore after decades of operating a community-based finance office, my offer to buy the company was immediately accepted.
As part of the acquisition price I obtained several hundred automobile notes (the loans secured by automobiles) owed by individual consumers on the Iron Range.

Noting that I knew this full well based upon what Mosey had told me, hence the reason he sold them to me, the accounts I purchased were all in a state of delinquency. Most of them were severely delinquent and my task, if I wanted to pursue it, was to either figure out a way to repossess the collateral or collect money from the person who owed it.
Now that I owned these assets, the first account I tried to collect on was a 1972 Fury Gran Coupe.  Having been born in 1976, this car was four years older than me – although at that period of time, it was just some old car and the outcome I wanted was to collect the $4000.00 of unpaid principle and accrued interest – or at least some portion of it.

As a business that was solely owned and tightly managed by Mosey, each account, which was represented by a 5x7, hand written index card with some details about when the loan was granted, how much money was owed, the serial number – make – and model of the car, and the address and phone number of the person who owed me the money that was obtained in the loan application years beforehand, gave me enough information to go and see the person.

Living in Minnesota in 1994, during our long winters, the people who take care of the local roadways were using salt on the roads to help melt the ice in so cars would have better traction. At that time, the normal product used was a rock salt that unfortunately caused significant corrosion to the body of any automobile that was not kept in the highest of care. Knowing that my collateral was 22 years old, candidly my expectations of this car were not high as I set out.

As far as collecting debts, as a very naive entrepreneur at the time, I called the police and asked them if they would help me collect on a delinquent loan. After much laughter, the explain that would be a civil action under the law and that I would need to hire a lawyer or employ some of my own methods to collect on a delinquent debt, as long as I followed the law in doing so.

It is also notable that in 1994, with automated calling systems in wide spread use, a fact that most automobile lending and subsequent collection of the delinquent loan accounts was done by large nationally based banks that had offices far away from the Iron Range and a number of other factors, it was a bit unusual that someone would show up at your door, ring your doorbell and bug you about getting paid. But alas I had no prior experience and by this time Mosey had passed away, and hence I had no mentor…so I walked up to the door and stated my case.

Bob (we will call him Bob for the purposes of this story) opened the door in comfortable around home type dress and proceeded to have a reasonable conversation. When we got around to how I could collect my money or the car (the collateral on the loan), he matter-of-factly pointed across the street and said “its over there…if you want it Ill help you put it onto a tow truck because “Kens Garage” is charging me $20 bucks a month to store it!

Although he offered to escort me over to it, I had already done my financial calculations from where we stood on his front porch. We shook hands, I told him I would get back to him, and I walked across the street to see what I could do. I took this picture, got back in my car, and decided that this would be my first lesson in buying a distressed asset.

…Its possible the car is still there today, except now 25 years late it may be finally increasing in value :-)
